# Shiny_collisions_app


This is a R Shiny application I developed for one of my projects at the NYC Data Science Academy. 

The application is an interactive web platform, displaying trends in vehicle - person collisions in New York City during 2015-2016. 

Trends can be displayed by adjusting the input values on the map and graph to glean the causes and clustering of accidents.
